# Spotify to MP3 Converter
Introduction
This project is a program designed to convert Spotify playlists into MP3 files. It extracts the song names from a Spotify playlist, downloads the corresponding audio from YouTube in WEBM format, and then converts the files to MP3.

# How It Works
Extract Song Names: The program extracts the names of the songs from the specified Spotify playlist.

Download Audio: It then searches for these songs on YouTube and downloads the audio in WEBM format.

Convert to MP3: Finally, the program converts the downloaded WEBM files into MP3 format.

# Usage
## Install Dependencies:

Run the  `requirements.bat` file to install all necessary dependencies.

## Run the Program:

Open a command prompt (CMD) and navigate to the directory where you have saved the project.

Run the following command:


```
python Finder.py
```

## Clean Up:

After the conversion process is complete, make sure to delete the WEBM files as they occupy significant storage space.

# Important Notes
Ensure you have a stable internet connection for downloading audio files.

The program requires Python to be installed on your system.

Always clean up the WEBM files after conversion to free up disk space.
